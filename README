# Spring Framework Tutorials

Welcome to the Spring Framework tutorials repository! This series is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in the Spring framework, a versatile and widely used framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. Let's dive into the first two tutorials:

## 1. Introduction to Spring Framework (Spring Tutorial 00)

### Overview

Welcome to the Spring Framework Tutorial 00: Introduction to Spring Framework. This tutorial provides a foundational understanding of the Spring framework, a robust and comprehensive framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. Let's delve into the key aspects of Spring.

### What is Spring?

**Spring** is an open-source framework for building enterprise applications in Java. It addresses the complexity of enterprise application development by providing a cohesive and modular infrastructure.

#### Key Features

1. **Inversion of Control (IoC):** In Spring, IoC is a core principle that shifts the control of program flow from the developer to the Spring container.
2. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Spring supports Aspect-Oriented Programming, allowing developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns like logging and security.
3. **Data Access:** Spring provides a consistent and simplified approach to data access through JDBC and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks.
4. **Transaction Management:** Spring facilitates declarative transaction management, ensuring data integrity in database operations.
5. **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Spring MVC is a powerful framework for building web applications following the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.

### Core Concepts

1. **Inversion of Control (IoC):** In Spring, IoC is achieved by the Spring container, which manages the lifecycle of application objects.
2. **Dependency Injection (DI):** Dependency Injection is a key concept where the Spring container injects dependencies into a class, promoting loose coupling.

### Spring Ecosystem

1. **Spring Boot:** Spring Boot simplifies the process of building production-ready applications, providing defaults for application setup and enhanced features like embedded servers.
2. **Spring Data:** Spring Data simplifies data access, providing a consistent approach to data repositories.
3. **Spring Security:** Spring Security offers comprehensive security services for Java EE-based enterprise software applications.

### Example: Hello, Spring!

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Spring!");
    }
}
```
